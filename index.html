      Say: High is my head!
Looking at my head
Is cast down the great Himalayan peak!
Say, Valiant,
Say: Ripping apart the wide sky of the universe,
Leaving behind the moon, the sun, the planets
and the stars
Piercing the earth and the heavens,
Pushing through Almighty's sacred seat
Have I risen,
I, the perennial wonder of mother-earth!
The angry God shines on my forehead
Like some royal victory's gorgeous emblem.
Say, Valiant,
Ever high is my head!

      Whether shopping for home or work, people value Amazon for its
      convenience, selection, and value. But businesses and organizations — from
      sole proprietorships to large enterprises, governments, schools, and
      healthcare organizations — have different needs than individual buyers.
      That’s why we created Amazon Business. Signing up is easy and creating an
      account is free. With business-relevant selection, innovative tools and
      features, and the convenience and value of Amazon, organizations of any
      size can simplify buying to drive toward their next stage of growth.
